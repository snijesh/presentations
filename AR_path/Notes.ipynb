    "Briefly, the signature genes of a given pathway (pathway-specific informative genes) and their regression weights were obtained through principal component analysis of the gene expression patterns of two training sample sets (one set with pathway being “on” and the other with pathway being “off”). To predict the pathway activity for a new sample, the binary regression on the principal components was applied to the gene expression profile of that sample after which a probability score (scaled to 0–1, used to represent the relative pathway activity) for the sample was generated."

The test statistic is assumed to have a normal distribution, and nuisance parameters such as standard deviation should be known in order for an accurate z-test to be performed."
