    "This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of lower extremity atherosclerotic disease (LEAD) in Chinese adult type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, and also explored the risk factors for LEAD and developed simple-to-use nomograms for LeAD and lesion degree in these patients. We retrospectively studied 4422 patients (male=2084; female= 2338) with T2D who were ≥50. Based on lower extremity arterial ultrasound findings, we divided the patients into three groups: normal, mild, and moderateto-severe group. The factors related to LEAD in patients with T2D were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. The risk factors for moderate-to-severe LEAD included: high HbA1c (OR=1.07 95% CI 1.02–1.13), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (OR =1.93 95% CI 1.57–2.37), and diabetic retinopathy (OR =1.26 95%CI 1.01–1.57). The overall areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the nomograms for predicting the risks of LEAD and moderate-to-severe LEAD in adult T2D patients were 0.793 (95%CI 0.720, 0.824) and 0.736 (95%CI 0.678, 0.795), respectively. The developed nomograms are simple to use and enable preliminary visual prediction of the risk and degree of LEAD in Chinese T2D patients over 50 years. The nomograms are accurate to a certain degree and provide a clinical basis for predicting the occurrence and progression of LeAD."

    "What Is a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)?\n",
    "Variance inflation factor (VIF) is a measure of the amount of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables. Mathematically, the VIF for a regression model variable is equal to the ratio of the overall model variance to the variance of a model that includes only that single independent variable. This ratio is calculated for each independent variable. A high VIF indicates that the associated independent variable is highly collinear with the other variables in the model."

    "What is the Odds Ratio?\n",
    "An odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association between a certain property A and a second property B in a population. Specifically, it tells you how the presence or absence of property A has an effect on the presence or absence of property B. The OR is also used to figure out if a particular exposure (like eating processed meat) is a risk factor for a particular outcome (such as colon cancer), and to compare the various risk factors for that outcome. You could use the OR to find out how much alcohol use leads to liver disease. Or you might want to find out if cell phone use has some link to brain cancer. As long as you have two properties you think are linked, you can calculate the odds."
