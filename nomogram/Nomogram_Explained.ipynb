    "\n",
    "- A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. <br><br>\n",
    "- Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. <br><br>\n",
    "- The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable.<br><br>\n",
    "- The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an index line or isopleth"
